🎵 MUSIC FILE INSTRUCTIONS 🎵

TO FIX "Error playing audio":

1. Download or find your binaural waves MP3 file
2. Rename it to: "simply-meditation-series-11hz-alpha-binaural-waves-for-relaxed-focus-8028.mp3"  
3. Place it in this folder: 
   c:\Users\vedas\Downloads\Attention_monitoring-main\Attention_monitoring-main\server\

ALTERNATIVE - Use any MP3 file:
1. Put any relaxing music MP3 file in this server folder
2. Rename it to match the expected filename above
3. The app will automatically loop it for longer sessions

RECOMMENDED:
- 11Hz Alpha binaural beats for focus
- 20-30 minutes duration  
- Instrumental/ambient music
- Low volume background music

Once the file is added, refresh your browser and the music controls will work!
